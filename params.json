{"name":"Qreview","tagline":"Making review process Easy","body":"### Welcome to Qreview Pages.\r\nReviewing the code and listing all the review item in tacking mode, is always important. Most of the scenarios, it is found that people use spreadsheet to track it. We found it less useful thru spreadsheet, so, developed Qreview.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply clone review repository to customise it for your need.\r\n\r\n### Technology Used\r\nWe tried to use some of the open source technologies with mixed flavour of technologies which we think we are good at.\r\nFollowing are the list of framework/api...\r\n\r\n1. play 2.1.1\r\n\r\n2. Java\r\n\r\n3. Scala\r\n\r\n4. JQuery\r\n\r\n5. Backbone JS\r\n\r\n6. Bootstrap (for the UI)  \r\n\r\n### Features\r\nRight now, only two features are available for the use,\r\n* Review Tracking\r\n* Task Listing\r\n\r\nTask listing is the cool one, which can be used for list all the short span todo's which could be always on to remember and list it all together.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@sunilp is the only contributor right now.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can comment on the pages for any support enquiry till we have official email communication.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
